# Raster Vision Marketing Site

The redesigned marketing site for the Raster Vision repo.

**Requirements**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/download/)

**Development**

To compile the code with Tailwind CSS and update on style change, run `npm run compile-css`.

In another tab, start the server by running `npm start`. View at localhost:8000. Refresh to see changes.

As a note, there is no staging site and all GitHub Actions builds (including test branches, PRs, and merges into `master`) will be deployed to the live site.
